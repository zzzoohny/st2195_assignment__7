survival of the passengers onboard.
 
2. Generate a histogram for the passengers’ age. Furthermore, describe the 
passengers’ age using the following two boxplots: age per ticket class and 
age based on survival. 
 
3. Generate a histogram for the travel fare and a table showing the number 
of people who did not pay – you may want to check on Google why a 
handful of people was on board for free! 
 
4. A chart of your choice to describe the family size per ticket class 
5. A series of stacked bar charts to show the how survival differs for 
different gender and ticket class 
 
6. A violin chart describing how survival related to age and gender 
 
7. A violin chart describing the survival rate related to age and ticket class 
 
Exploratory analysis: 
From the graphs above, what kind of associations between the variables like 
age, gender, ticket class and the survival do you observe?
 
Note: it would be best to use ggplot.
